Shopkeeper is a [oclif](https://oclif.io/) plugin and makes heavy use of the APIs provided
by the [Shopify CLI](https://github.com/shopify/cli).

Because we want a seamless experience, we follow the patterns set out by Shopify as much as possible.
Reading the Shopify CLI [contributor guide](https://github.com/Shopify/cli/tree/main/docs) is an excellent
place to start.
